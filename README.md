# energyCalc

This is a SPA created using React. The energy calculator is a way for you to calculate how much electricity common appliances use over the period of a month. I've tried to make it as self explanatory as possible. 


The useage is asking for the amount of hours you would use the appliance over the month so I would recommend you calculate your daily usage and multiply y the number of days in the month.
